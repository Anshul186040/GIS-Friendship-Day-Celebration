# GIS-Friendship-Day-Celebration
FRIENDSHIP-CARD-PROJECT - Being a student moderator of a GITHUB slack channel at Google India Scholars, I initiated this activity for everyone in this workspace..
All track students abnd, mws, and & fend students make a friendship card with their friends names by implementing their so far learned  technical knowledge.
sample cards for Android and Web developers
